# PRAKTIKUM
This is a collection of all of my assignments from various programming classes during my studies @iSTTS

### What is inside?
<p>This repo contains all of my collective assignments that I've built/made during my studies @iSTTS.<br> In each folder you can expect to find every single weekly project/assignment that I've done and in some folders you might also find a list of specs required for the project in a word file</p>

### Why is this repo made?
<p> This repo is made to ensure that none of my progress during my studies @iSTTS is lost over a harddrive malfunction. It also serves as a tool for me to remember certain programming language incase I need to re-use them in the future, as well as to help me in my part-time position as a Classroom asistant @iSTTS. This repo is also made for my underclassmens to read incase any of them needs reference on each class.
