# WS-PRAK
This repo is a collection of all of my weekly assignments for my WebService class [@iSTTS](https://www.istts.ac.id/).

# Disclaimer
This repository is not by any means made to be used in a professional background, it is only made in the hopes of helping others who're just starting to make REST APIs as an example. Personally, this is made as an example for college-level students.

# What's inside?
Every single directory contains:
1. an ExpressJS based API.
2. the specifications of each API (in the form of an assignment sheet.)
3. the SQL file for each API that uses a database.

# First Time Setup
How to start the API :
1. Download a directory/the whole repo
2. If you're downloading it manually, extract the file into a directory first.
3. Import the database (if the aforementioned API uses a database) into your localhost.
4. Make sure you have NodeJS installed alongside npm.
5. Open the code in an editor (I recommend using VSCode since its the editor that I used during development.)
6. Open a terminal (in VSCode, it is intergrated into the editor), and write npm install. Make sure that the terminal is in the directory in which the aforementioned API is extracted.
7. start the API with node <script name> or npx nodemon <script name> (some may not work with nodemon, as I don't remember using it on each of them)
8. start testing the API with the help of Postman (https://www.postman.com/)
